- Start dev server and open these routes:
  - /login – mock login page (use any email/password)
  - /dashboard – dashboard after login
  - /appraisal/general-details – section 1
  - /appraisal/conference-events – section 2
  - /appraisal/research-papers – section 8
  - Other appraisal routes render a placeholder and are linked via the sidebar
